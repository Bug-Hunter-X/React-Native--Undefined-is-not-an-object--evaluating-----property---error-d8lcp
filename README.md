# React Native: 'Undefined is not an object' Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon 'undefined is not an object (evaluating '...property')' error in React Native and provides a solution.

## Bug Description
The error occurs when accessing a property or method of a component before it has fully rendered or its state has been initialized.  This often happens when there's an asynchronous operation involved (e.g., fetching data) and attempting to access data before it's available.

## Solution
The solution involves using conditional rendering or state management to ensure you only try to access properties or methods once they're defined or the data is loaded.
